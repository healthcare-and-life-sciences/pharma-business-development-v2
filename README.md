# Pharma Business Development 

## **Overview**

 Pharma companies use their business development teams to drive the identification, evaluation, and management of acquisition, licensing, and partnership opportunities. This package builds on Sales Cloud to add features for three main areas: (1) search and evaluation of leads, (2) management of in-licensing and out-licensing

## **Business Objective**

As a Pharma Business Development team member, I need a quick, mobile-friendly, and personalized way to manage my leads, opportunities and projects with potential clients.

Today information is housed in multiple systems which arenâ€™t always easy to access, and if in Salesforce, this information is not tailored to my individual needs resulting in additional, and unnecessary, steps.

This gives a single view in my console (both desktop and mobile) to manage and prioritize leads, taking into account licensing, contracts, alliance deals, and financial/non-financial obligations.
